                        develop their careers in the IT industry. Work based learning elements are key throughout your
                        studies on the FdSc and, therefore, it is ideal for either full-time or part-time study
                        alongside an existing IT position. The foundation degree was created by consulting with local
                        employers such as BGL Group (Compare the Market) to ensure the course meets their needs and
                        ensures graduates have the skills required for industry.<br><br>

                        Computing is changing our world by the way we work and the way we live. To study computer
                        science is to put you at the forefront not just of technological change, but of social change
                        too. This course studies the principles and technologies underpinning the systems that are
                        driving this change.<br><br>

                        You will study a number of modules designed to promote your professional growth and personal
                        development whilst providing an opportunity to build upon these directly through a combination
                        of work- based learning projects and traditional classroom based study. During your studies you
                        will be encouraged to acquire key practical skills to help you build specialist knowledge within
                        computing.<br><br>

                        The field of computing offers a wealth of opportunities across a range of specialist fields and
                        the variety of course options on offer means that you can fine-tune your degree to focus on
                        particular areas of interest or to meet the requirements of a favoured career.<br><br>

                        Employability is a key focus with guest speakers from industry, real case studies, vocational
                        assignment scenarios and modules that have been developed alongside employers. Work-based
                        learning modules will encourage you to reflect on and further develop the professional skills
                        gained in the work place. Students also take part the Global Day of Code and Agile Peterborough
                        events, along with regular sessions for meeting professionals and build working
                        relationships.<br><br>

                        The courses at University Centre Peterborough are studied in smaller class sizes compared with
                        other universities, a typical class size is under 30 students.<br><br>

                        <h4>ACCREDITATION OF PRIOR CERTIFICATED LEARNING (APCL) FOR ENTRY</h4><br>

                        APCL relates to learning completed through an earlier course of study. If you have previously
                        completed a course which is relevant to your proposed course you should make this clear when you
                        apply. For this to be eligible for consideration you must be able to provide certification,
                        which shows your success in a final assessment for that course. Learning must be completed in
                        the last five years or further evidence of updating will be required. Simple participation in a
                        course or an attendance certificate is not sufficient.<br><br>

                        <h4>EXEMPTIONS BASED ON ACCREDITATION OF PRIOR LEARNING (APL)</h4><br>

                        We offer students flexibility in their studies, by recognising learning they may have completed
                        elsewhere before they apply. The Accreditation of Prior Learning process ensures that we can
                        take this into account when determining the modules you must study. It is important that you
                        identify any relevant prior learning when you apply. If your previous study specifically relates
                        to modules on the course you wish to undertake we may approve a reduced programme of study, thus
                        shortening the time it takes to obtain your award. Where this relates to learning completed
                        through an earlier course of study, this is called Prior Certificated Learning, and where
                        learning has been achieved through relevant work or experience, this is referred to as Prior
                        Experiential Learning. Claims must be approved before you commence a course.<br><br>

                        <h4>EXEMPTIONS BASED ON ACCREDITATION OF PRIOR EXPERIENTIAL CERTIFICATED LEARNING (APEL)</h4>
                        <br>

                        It is important to understand that the APEL process does not award academic credit for
                        experience alone, but for learning which can be shown to have been achieved through that
                        experience. Students are required to prepare an individual case for the credit arising from
                        their learning experiences. This normally means that a student receives support in the
                        preparation of a portfolio, which evidences their claimed exemptions for entry. This portfolio
                        of evidence is then submitted for assessment and the possible award of academic credit.
                        Alternative methods of assessment of evidence may be available but needs to be discussed

                                                        IT within organisational contexts. Database Management
                                                        Systems (DBMS) provide the systems, tools and interfaces by
                                                        which the organisation can manage their information and use it

                                                        The students develop advanced design concepts based on Entity
                                                        Relationship Diagrams and apply these to real-world cases.
                                                        They also develop their knowledge of SQL beyond basic queries by

                                                        Object oriented programming is a programming language model
                                                        organised around objects rather than actions and data rather
                                                        than logic. Industry dictates that the reuse of code is a
                                                        fundamental skill required of graduates as this leads to
                                                        cleaner, more
                                                        robust code. Object Oriented programming also facilitates the
                                                        generation of Test Driven Development.</br></br>
                                                        The module will expose students to the fundamentals of Object
                                                        Oriented Program Design and Development. Students will
                                                        receive a solid understanding of Object Oriented Techniques
                                                        including Inheritance, Association, Aggregation, Polymorphism
                                                        and Encapsulation and how these techniques are utilised in a
                                                        business environment. Design techniques such as CRC cards
                                                        will aid the creation of software and students will develop

                                                        Students will gain practical programming knowledge through the
                                                        development of programs in an object-oriented language

                                                        The learning will be assessed through weekly in-class tasks and
                                                        by the students writing a program to meet a brief supported

                                                        This module focuses on the key concepts of network switching and
                                                        routing.
                                                        It introduces the learner to converged networks and examines
                                                        some of the underpinning building blocks of this technology.
                                                        The module then looks at how networking devices are configured
                                                        and how the data is switched and subsequently routed
                                                        between networks. Network security features are also
                                                        considered.</br></br>
                                                        There is a focus on how data can be handled discreetly and more
                                                        securely by the implementing and configuring Virtual Local
                                                        Area Networks (VLAN). This knowledge is then extended so the
                                                        network can be configured to allow inter VLAN routing to
                                                        take place.</br></br>

                                                        through a series of guided laboratory exercises. In the lab
                                                        sessions students will gain deep understanding on the routing
                                                        and
                                                        switching concepts and acquire hands-on-skills using advanced

                                                        Object oriented programming is a programming language model
                                                        organised around objects rather than actions and data rather
                                                        than logic. Industry dictates that the reuse of code is a
                                                        fundamental skill required of graduates as this leads to
                                                        cleaner, more
                                                        robust code. Object Oriented programming also facilitates the
                                                        generation of Test Driven Development.</br></br>
                                                        The module will expose students to the fundamentals of Object
                                                        Oriented Program Design and Development. Students will
                                                        receive a solid understanding of Object Oriented Techniques
                                                        including Inheritance, Association, Aggregation, Polymorphism
                                                        and Encapsulation and how these techniques are utilised in a
                                                        business environment. Design techniques such as CRC cards
                                                        will aid the creation of software and students will develop
                                                        Class Diagrams and other UML documentation.</br></br>
                                                        Students will gain practical programming knowledge through the
                                                        development of programs in an object-oriented language
                                                        such as C# and Java.</br></br>
                                                        The learning will be assessed through weekly in-class tasks and
                                                        by the students writing a program to meet a brief supported

                                                        interactive online activities on a weekly basis to support

                        When studying this course at University Centre Peterborough, we will timetable your lectures as
                        two full days a week over two semesters per year (part-time will be one to two full days a week
                        over two semesters per year).<br><br>

                        We are able to offer this convenient timetabling to our students as we are a smaller institution
                        so we can timetable our staff and resources more efficiently.<br><br>

                        Over the duration of your course, teaching will be delivered by the following methods:<br><br>

                        <h4>Year one for full-time students (Level 4)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>35% Lectures</li>
                            <li>45% Seminars</li>
                            <li>20% Workshops</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Final year for full-time students (Level 5)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>30% Lectures</li>
                            <li>50% Seminars</li>
                            <li>20% Workshops</li>
                        </ul>

                        There are two semesters per year and each semester is up to 15 weeks which includes up to 12
                        teaching weeks and 3 assessment weeks.</br></br>

                        If studying full-time you will be in classes, seminars and tutorials for approximately 15 hours
                        per week and will spend the rest of your time in independent study and extra-curricular
                        activities including work placement if not embedded in your course. We recommend that full-time
                        students allow an additional 30 hours per week for additional study.</br></br>

                        The campus is open Monday to Friday throughout the whole year and open until 9pm from Monday to
                        Thursday during term time. You will also have 24/7 access to a virtual learning environment
                        (VLE) with e-books, journals and abstracts plus teaching resources and interactive
                        tools.</br></br>

                        Timetables are available at least one month before registration and you can refer to the
                        academic calendar for examination weeks and resit periods.</br></br>

                        The days of the week you study may change each year and in some circumstances one of the full
                        days might have to be split into two half days, but we aim to keep these as full days where
                        possible.</br></br>

                        <br><br>As the course is timetabled as full days during the week when studied full-time, this
                        also gives
                        you the flexibility to find a work placement, internship or volunteering opportunity which will
                        improve your employability after you graduate. All students are encouraged to identify work
                        experience to aid their career development.</br></br>

                        I am the Course Leader for the FdSc and BSc (Hons) Computing & Information Systems degrees at
                        University Centre Peterborough. I have been teaching computing related subjects since January
                        2007 and have been teaching at University Centre Peterborough since September 2009 on modules
                        including Programming Concepts, Digital Asset Development and Developing Interactive Web
                        Solutions.</br></br>

                        I have held industry positions as a Software Developer producing bespoke systems for the supply
                        chain industry, working to develop custom solutions for various departments. From 2003 to 2007,
                        I worked as a Database Administrator which involved migrating legacy systems from Microsoft
                        Access to an SQL Server platform and further developing the system as business needs
                        changed.</br></br>

                        I have also worked in the Canadian media industry as an Animator and Film Editor on various
                        projects for television and independent films. During this period, I worked with NISH media to
                        animate and combine live action footage with computer animations for children’s television
                        shows. I also produced animated 3D models for complex movie previsualisations.</br></br>

                        I am interested in Video Game Design and Development, having produced a number of independent
                        games over that last 15 years and winning an award for Educational Video Game Design in 2010.
                        More recently my focus has been on developing the Computing and Information Systems degree,
                        working with the local computing industry to meet their needs and to modernise delivery with
                        wider industry practices, ensuring graduates have the skills that are widely sought
